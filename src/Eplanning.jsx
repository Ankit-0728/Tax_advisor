                      Estate planning can be complex and costly if done independently. It involves numerous considerations, including state taxes, bureaucracy, probate courts, appraisals, health care concerns, heirs' eligibility, life insurance, IRAs, annuities, and end-of-life wishes. Without a thorough understanding of your legal and financial rights, you might incur higher costs.
