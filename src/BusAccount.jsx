    <h1>Small Business Accounting</h1>
    <p>As a small business owner, your priority is running your business and generating profits, not managing your books. Let us handle your bookkeeping so you can focus on what matters most.</p>

    <h2>Our Monthly or Quarterly Services</h2>
    <p>Each month or quarter, we provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bank account reconciliation</li>
        <li>Income statement generation</li>
        <li>Balance sheet preparation</li>
        <li>General ledger cleanup</li>
        <li>Unlimited consultations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These essential tasks form the foundation of your small business accounting system. You can further tailor your package with additional services like payroll, tax planning, tax preparation, and more.</p>

    <h2>Bank Reconciliation</h2>
    <p>Reconciling your business checking account each month ensures your bank account, accounting, and taxes remain up-to-date. Our monthly reconciliation helps you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify lost checks, lost deposits, and unauthorized transactions</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent excessive or unjustified bank charges</li>
        <li>Prevent internal embezzlement</li>
        <li>Accurately assess your business's financial health</li>
        <li>Manage cash more effectively, saving and generating money</li>
        <li>Protect against unauthorized, fraudulent, or forged checks by promptly addressing them with your bank</li>
        <li>Sleep better knowing your accounts are balanced and accurate</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Income Statement</h2>
    <p>An income statement, or profit and loss statement, itemizes your revenues and expenses to show your profit or loss for the period. It helps you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Track revenues and expenses to evaluate your business's performance</li>
        <li>Identify over-budget or under-budget areas</li>
        <li>Pinpoint unexpected expenditures, such as phone, fax, mail, or supplies</li>
        <li>Monitor increases in product returns or cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales</li>
        <li>Determine your income tax liability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Balance Sheet</h2>
    <p>A balance sheet provides a snapshot of your business's financial condition at a specific moment. It helps you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quickly assess the financial strength and capabilities of your business</li>
        <li>Identify and analyze trends in receivables and payables</li>
        <li>Determine if your business can expand</li>
        <li>Handle normal financial fluctuations in revenues and expenses</li>
        <li>Decide if immediate steps are needed to bolster cash reserves</li>
        <li>Check if slowing down payables indicates a potential cash shortage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Balance sheets, along with income statements, are essential for financial reporting to potential lenders, such as banks, investors, and vendors.</p>

    <h2>Maintaining a Clean General Ledger</h2>
    <p>The general ledger is the core of your company's financial records. Every transaction flows through it, so any problem affects all your books. Monthly reviews of your general ledger allow us to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify and correct discrepancies, such as double billings or unrecorded payments</li>
        <li>Ensure your books are always accurate and in top condition</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unlimited Consultations</h2>
    <p>We are always available to help you understand and use the financial information we provide. Our consultations are included in our price, so feel free to contact us whenever you have questions or concerns.</p>
